# Deploy Web Application on MongoDB Using Kubernetes

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps to deploy a web application that uses MongoDB as its database on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. By following these instructions, you will set up a complete deployment environment where MongoDB and your web application are configured to work together seamlessly.

## Components

- **MongoDB Secret:** Manages sensitive information such as MongoDB credentials (username and password).
- **MongoDB Configuration:** Provides necessary configuration settings required for MongoDB to function.
- **MongoDB Deployment:** Defines how MongoDB is deployed and managed within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **MongoDB Service:** Exposes the MongoDB instance to other services within the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. **Start Minikube**
   - Begin by initializing Minikube to create a local Kubernetes cluster. This sets up the environment where all subsequent deployments will occur.

2. **Apply Configuration Files**
   - Deploy MongoDB and the web application using the provided configuration files. These files include settings and definitions for both MongoDB and the web application, ensuring they are correctly set up and can communicate with each other.

3. **Verify Deployments**
   - Confirm that both MongoDB and the web application services are running correctly. Use Kubernetes commands to check the status of your deployments and ensure everything is functioning as expected.

4. **Access the Web App**
   - Access the deployed web application through the specified port. This allows you to interact with your application and verify that it is connected to the MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository. Make sure you have Minikube and Kubernetes CLI tools installed on your local machine.
